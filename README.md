# Grammar-Engineering

This project creates a grammar for parsing a small subset of English sentences using feature structures and subcategorization methodology. At the inital stage of the system, a context-free grammar was implemented to parse the sentences, but in the follwing implementations a unification grammar was created in order to provide a more elegant solution to the subcategorization problem.
